	abstract = {Phase unwrapping is the inference of absolute phase from modulo-2 phase. This paper introduces a new energy minimization framework for phase unwrapping. The considered objective functions are first-order Markov random fields. We provide an exact energy minimization algorithm, whenever the corresponding clique potentials are convex, namely for the phase unwrapping classical norm, with 1. Its complexity is (3), where is the length of the absolute phase domain measured in 2 units and () is the complexity of a max-flow computation in a graph with nodes and edges. For nonconvex clique potentials, often used owing to their dis-continuity preserving ability, we face an NP-hard problem for which we devise an approximate solution. Both algorithms solve integer optimization problems by computing a sequence of binary optimizations, each one solved by graph cut techniques. Accordingly , we name the two algorithms PUMA, for phase unwrapping max-flow/min-cut. A set of experimental results illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its competitiveness in comparison with state-of-the-art phase unwrapping algorithms.},

We formulate a natural approach for solving this problem, which works with angular embeddings of the noisy mod 1 samples over the unit circle, inspired by the angular synchronization framework. This amounts to solving a smoothness regularized least-squares problem -- a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) -- where the variables are constrained to lie on the unit circle. Our approach is based on solving its relaxation, which is a trust-region sub-problem and hence solvable efficiently. We provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating its robustness to noise for adversarial, and random Gaussian and Bernoulli noise models. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first such theoretical results for this problem. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach via extensive numerical simulations on synthetic data, along with a simple least-squares solution for the unwrapping stage, that recovers the original samples of {\$}f{\$} (up to a global shift). It is shown to perform well at high levels of noise, when taking as input the denoised modulo {\$}1{\$} samples. Finally, we also consider two other approaches for denoising the modulo 1 samples that leverage tools from Riemannian optimization on manifolds, including a Burer-Monteiro approach for a semidefinite programming relaxation of our formulation. For the two-dimensional version of the problem, which has applications in radar interferometry, we are able to solve instances of real-world data with a million sample points in under 10 seconds, on a personal laptop.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of recovering a signal x * ∈ R n , from magnitude-only measurements, y i = ||a i , x * | for i = {\{}1, 2, . . . , m{\}}. Also known as the phase retrieval problem, it is a fundamental challenge in nano-, bio-and astronomical imaging systems, and speech processing. The problem is ill-posed, and therefore additional assumptions on the signal and/or the measurements are necessary. In this paper, we first study the case where the underlying signal x * is s-sparse. We develop a novel recovery algorithm that we call Compressive Phase Retrieval with Alternating Minimization, or CoPRAM. Our algorithm is simple and can be obtained via a natural combination of the classical alternating minimization approach for phase retrieval, with the CoSaMP algorithm for sparse recovery. Despite its simplicity, we prove that our algorithm achieves a sample complexity of O s 2 log n with Gaussian samples, which matches the best known existing results. It also demonstrates linear convergence in theory and practice and requires no extra tuning parameters other than the signal sparsity level s. We then consider the case where the underlying signal x * arises from structured sparsity models. We specifically examine the case of block-sparse signals with uniform block size of b and block sparsity k = s/b. For this problem, we design a recovery algorithm that we call Block CoPRAM that further reduces the sample complexity to O (ks log n). For sufficiently large block lengths of b = $\Theta$(s), this bound equates to O (s log n). To our knowledge, this constitutes the first end-to-end linearly convergent algorithm for phase retrieval where the Gaussian sample complexity has a sub-quadratic dependence on the sparsity level of the signal.},

	abstract = {Phase retrieval problems involve solving linear equations, but with missing sign (or phase, for complex numbers) information. Over the last two decades, a popular generic empirical approach to the many variants of this problem has been one of alternating minimization; i.e. alternating between estimating the missing phase information, and the candidate solution. In this paper, we show that a simple alternating minimization algorithm geometrically converges to the solution of one such problem -- finding a vector {\$}x{\$} from {\$}y,A{\$}, where {\$}y = |A{\^{}}T x|{\$} and {\$}|z|{\$} denotes a vector of element-wise magnitudes of {\$}z{\$} -- under the assumption that {\$}A{\$} is Gaussian. Empirically, our algorithm performs similar to recently proposed convex techniques for this variant (which are based on "lifting" to a convex matrix problem) in sample complexity and robustness to noise. However, our algorithm is much more efficient and can scale to large problems. Analytically, we show geometric convergence to the solution, and sample complexity that is off by log factors from obvious lower bounds. We also establish close to optimal scaling for the case when the unknown vector is sparse. Our work represents the only known theoretical guarantee for alternating minimization for any variant of phase retrieval problems in the non-convex setting.},

	abstract = {Shannon's sampling theorem provides a link between the continuous and the discrete realms stating that bandlimited signals are uniquely determined by its values on a discrete set. This theorem is realized in practice using so called analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Unlike Shannon's sampling theorem, the ADCs are limited in dynamic range. Whenever a signal exceeds some preset threshold, the ADC saturates, resulting in aliasing due to clipping. The goal of this paper is to analyze an alternative approach that does not suffer from these problems. Our work is based on recent developments in ADC design, which allow for ADCs that reset rather than to saturate, thus producing modulo samples. An open problem that remains is: Given such modulo samples of a bandlimited function as well as the dynamic range of the ADC, how can the original signal be recovered and what are the sufficient conditions that guarantee perfect recovery? In this paper, we prove such sufficiency conditions and complement them with a stable recovery algorithm. Our results not limited to certain amplitude ranges, in fact even the same circuit architecture allows for the recovery of arbitrary large amplitudes as long as some estimate of the signal norm is available when recovering. Numerical experiments that corroborate our theory indeed show that it is possible to perfectly recover function that takes values that are orders of magnitude higher than the ADC's threshold.},

	abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017. Photographing scenes with high dynamic range (HDR) poses great challenges to consumer cameras with their limited sensor bit depth. To address this, Zhao et al. recently proposed a novel sensor concept – the modulo camera – which captures the least significant bits of the recorded scene instead of going into saturation. Similar to conventional pipelines, HDR images can be reconstructed from multiple exposures, but significantly fewer images are needed than with a typical saturating sensor. While the concept is appealing, we show that the original reconstruction approach assumes noise-free measurements and quickly breaks down otherwise. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction algorithm that is robust to image noise and produces significantly fewer artifacts. We theoretically analyze correctness as well as limitations, and show that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline on real data.},

	abstract = {The Compressive Sensing (CS) framework aims to ease the burden on analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) by reducing the sampling rate required to acquire and stably recover sparse signals. Practical ADCs not only sample but also quantize each measurement to a finite number of bits; moreover, there is an inverse relationship between the achievable sampling rate and the bit depth. In this paper, we investigate an alternative CS approach that shifts the emphasis from the sampling rate to the number of bits per measurement. In particular, we explore the extreme case of 1-bit CS measurements, which capture just their sign. Our results come in two flavors. First, we consider ideal reconstruction from noiseless 1-bit measurements and provide a lower bound on the best achievable reconstruction error. We also demonstrate that i.i.d. random Gaussian matrices describe measurement mappings achieving, with overwhelming probability, nearly optimal error decay. Next, we consider reconstruction robustness to measurement errors and noise and introduce the Binary {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$}-Stable Embedding (B{\$}\backslashepsilon{\$}SE) property, which characterizes the robustness measurement process to sign changes. We show the same class of matrices that provide almost optimal noiseless performance also enable such a robust mapping. On the practical side, we introduce the Binary Iterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) algorithm for signal reconstruction from 1-bit measurements that offers state-of-the-art performance.},
