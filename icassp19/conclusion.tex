\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:disc}
In this paper, for signal recovery from compressed modulo measurements, we presented a novel algorithmic approach inspired from the classical phase retrieval solutions. Our mathematical and experimental analysis support our claim of exact signal recovery through proposed algorithm. Several open questions remain that can serve as the future directions of our work. While in this paper we considered only two periods within the modulo operation, extending the proposed approach for more periods (and theoretically infinite periods) is a significant and interesting research direction. Instead of relying on sparsity prior for compressed recovery, employing novel set of priors such as GAN priors\cite{bora2017compressed,shah2018solving} can also be a direction to be explored. Moreover, our analysis is limited to the case of Gaussian measurements, thus extending our results to various measurement schemes such as Fourier samples can be an interesting problem for future study.
